You may use the data returned by the API on your website or in a software application that you own. You may not resell any of the data or share it with 3rd parties. No user may provide Rewards Credit Card API data via their own API to users, or provide a mechanism for mass downloads, for example as a CSV. You may cache data returned from the Rewards Credit Card API for up to 30 days, at which point the data must be deleted or re-queried. For all accounts, you are required to delete any data you have cached from the Rewards Credit Card API when your account is cancelled or terminated.
