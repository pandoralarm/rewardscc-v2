### There's a custom endpoint that would really help, is it possible to have it added? {#my-faq1-id}

Yes! We will engineer a custom endpoint that will suit you needs. Send us an email at **[rewardscc.info@gmail.com](mailto:rewardscc.info@gmail.com)** with your request.

### Do you add your own affiliate links in any of the url's? {#my-faq1a-id}

No we do not. All provided links are direct to the bank. You are more than welcome to replace our links with affiliate links of your own. In fact, it's encouraged. 

### I can't find a card, can you add it? {#my-faq2-id}

Absolutely. Send us your request at **[rewardscc.info@gmail.com](mailto:rewardscc.info@gmail.com)** and we will get it added to the API within 24 hours.

### Why is the sign-up bonus different than what's on the bank's website?  {#my-faq3-id}

Depending on the bank a bonus may differ based on an IP address (American Express for example). If you have any questions on a specific bonus or believe it may have been updated, please let us know at **[rewardscc.info@gmail.com](mailto:rewardscc.info@gmail.com)** and we'll get back to you within the day.

### Can I redistribute the data I receive from Rewards Credit Card API?  {#my-faq4-id}

No user may provide Rewards Credit Card API data via their own API to users, or provide a mechanism for mass downloads, for example as a CSV. 

### May I download the data locally and continue to use it after my subscription has ended?  {#my-faq5-id}

Once a subscription has ended the data must be removed and deleted from any storage or application you may be using.

### How can I contact you?  {#my-faq6-id}
